#  Your first neural network

### The first project of the [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)


The project is about building a Neural Network to predict the number of future bike rentals based on a real-life [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). 
The project was implemented in Python and using libraries such as: _numpy_,  _matplotlib_ and _pandas_.

#### Topics covered are:

- Regression Models
- Perceptrons 
- Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation
